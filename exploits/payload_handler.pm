		This module can be used to interact with a payload that was
	not directly injected by the Framework itself. This allows you 
	to use payloads from the Metasploit Framework in an external program
	without having to rewrite it as an exploit module. This module an be
	used to interact with standalone executable payloads, such as those
	created by the 'X' action of the msfpayload utility.
